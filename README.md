### Ideas for new version (2022)
- Set PWM freq in EEPROM, high freq for picture mode, low for performance mode  
- Battery powered. 4S 18650 circuit  
- Drive LEDs directly from Battery  
- Use same voltage regulator to get a 3.3V  
- Change MOSFETs to logic-level (3.3V) ones, or drive with NPN transistor  
- Implement gyroscope  
- Research mic implementation  

- ESP32s2 or ESP32 WROOM?  
- Rethink LED configuration (Strip + circle-panel for top?)  

- Build own cement base with screw holes.  
- Add screw from bottom to cement base  
- RGBW instead of RGB?  
- Implement internal lag for lower framerates  

- Turn on / off  
  - Button (preferred)
  - Battery connector
